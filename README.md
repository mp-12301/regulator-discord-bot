# The Rock Discord Bot

The Rock will track users present in the voice channel and will keep an eye open if someone just talks too much.

If you are a fan of the Rock and want a discord bot to shut up your friends when they talk too much feel free to use it.

At the moment the tolerance is hardcoded in `src/rock.ts` but I plan to be able to configure it through sending commands to the bot in the future.
